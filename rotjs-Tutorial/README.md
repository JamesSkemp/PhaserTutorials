# rot.js (ROguelike Toolkit in JavaScript) Tutorial

While not about Phaser, it seems [rot.js](http://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/) is used together with it for some games.

This project is based upon the tutorial, [Ananas aus Caracas: a sample game built using rot.js](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Rot.js_tutorial), linked to from the official site of the project.
