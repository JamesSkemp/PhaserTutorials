# Starter Project (Simple) for Phaser with TypeScript

The following is a simple starter project to get started with a new game in Phaser, using TypeScript.

## What This Provides

- assets
	- This directory can be used to store any assets (images, audio, etcetera) that your game will use.
	- The Phaser logo (Phaser-Logo-Small.png) is a trademark of Photon Storm, and is meant to be used in a manner consistent with their [usage guidelines](http://phaser.io/download/trademark).
- lib
	- This directory includes [Phaser 2.6.1](http://phaser.io/), and the necessary TypeScript definitions.
- src
	- This directory is intended to store the core game TypeScript file, and includes a .gitignore so that any JavaScript files that are built aren't committed.
- app.css can include any styling necessary for your application.
- app.ts
	- This file includes the code required to start Phaser.
	- This file should be updated with the preferred width and height of your game.
	- If you're considering adding additional states, take a look at the normal Starter Project template.
- favicon.ico
	- HTML5 Logo by [World Wide Web Consortium/W3C](http://www.w3.org/) and included here based upon the [logo FAQ](http://www.w3.org/html/logo/faq.html) allowing it (and it seems like the best logo to start with).
- index.html
	- The `title` and `h1` elements should be updated to match the needs of your game.
	- Includes a reference to the minified Phaser library.
	- Also includes a reference to a JavaScript file, which the Visual Studio project is setup to output TypeScript files to, and which should be updated to match your needs.
- README.md is this file, and should be replaced with whatever content is needed for your game.
- web(.*).config
	- These three files are specific to IIS/ASP.NET, but do not include anything required for deployment.
