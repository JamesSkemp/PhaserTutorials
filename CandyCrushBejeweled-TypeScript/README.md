# Candy Crush/Bejeweled game, done in TypeScript

NOTE: There are some pretty serious issues with how this game works. I need to go through and figure out why the input goes crazy, but I'm planning on finishing the related Zenva tutorial first.

The following is based upon Josh Morony's [How to Create a Candy Crush or Bejeweled Game in Phaser](http://www.joshmorony.com/how-to-create-a-candy-crush-or-bejeweled-game-in-phaser/), but updated to use TypeScript.

Assets supposedly taken from [one of Kenney's assets](http://kenney.nl/).
