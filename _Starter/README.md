# Starter Project for Phaser with TypeScript

The following is a starter project to get started with a new game in Phaser, using TypeScript.

## What This Provides

This starter project starts with the lib directory, which contains Phaser 2.4.4, and the necessary TypeScript definitions.

It also includes an empty assets directory, in which to store your images, audio, and other associated files.

The src directory is intended to store your TypeScript files, and includes a .gitignore so that any JavaScript files that are built aren't committed.

app.css can include any styling necessary for your application.

index.html should have the `title` and `h1` elements updated to match the needs of your game. Otherwise it includes a reference to the minified Phaser library and a reference to a JavaScript file, which the project is setup to output TypeScript files to, and which should be updated to match your needs.

README.md is this file, and should be replaced with whatever content is needed for your game.
