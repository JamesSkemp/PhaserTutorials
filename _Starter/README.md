# Starter Project for Phaser with TypeScript

The following is a starter project to get started with a new game in Phaser, using TypeScript.

## What This Provides

- assets
	- This directory can be used to store any assets (images, audio, etcetera) that your game will use.
- lib
	- This directory includes [Phaser 2.4.4](http://phaser.io/), and the necessary TypeScript definitions.
- src
	- This directory is intended to store your TypeScript files, and includes a .gitignore so that any JavaScript files that are built aren't committed.
	- A possible directory structure, as well as a few starter states, have been added for ease, but can be removed without issue.
- app.css can include any styling necessary for your application.
- index.html
	- The `title` and `h1` elements should be updated to match the needs of your game.
	- Includes a reference to the minified Phaser library.
	- Also includes a reference to a JavaScript file, which the Visual Studio project is setup to output TypeScript files to, and which should be updated to match your needs.
- README.md is this file, and should be replaced with whatever content is needed for your game.
- web(.*).config
	- These three files are specific to IIS/ASP.NET, but do not include anything required for deployment.
