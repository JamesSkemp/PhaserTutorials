# Level Select options

This project is based upon the following tutorials:

1. Emanuele Feronato's [How to create a level selection screen with locked levels and stars][1a] and [How to create a level selection screen with locked levels and stars – finished prototype][1b], but converted to TypeScript.
2. Emanuele Feronato's [Create an HTML5 level selection screen using a scrollable map like in “Hero Emblems” game using Phaser][2], but converted to TypeScript and improved to work with Phaser 2.4.6.
