# Radical Prototype (part two), done in TypeScript

The following is based upon Emanuele Feronato's [Creation of an HTML5 game like Radical using Phaser and Arcade Physics](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2015/11/13/creation-of-an-html5-game-like-radical-using-phaser-and-arcade-physics-step-1/), but updated to use TypeScript.

Since I found the part two version of the game to be so much different than part one, I opted to create a new project for it, instead of keeping all changes in the existing project.
