# Phaser Tutorials

See individual README files for information on where each tutorial is from.

## Templates

As I've worked through the various tutorials I've created two templates that I use for my own projects.

### _Starter

Of special note is the **_Starter** project which I'll be using as my base project, and will be updating as needed in the future.

This project uses TypeScript with Phaser (2.4.6).

### _Starter Simple

This project uses TypeScript with Phaser (2.4.6), and aims to be a simple version of the **_Starter** project.
