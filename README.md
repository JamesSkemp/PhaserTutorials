## Templates

As I've worked through the various tutorials I've created two templates that I use for my own projects.

### _Starter

Of special note is the **_Starter** project which I'll be using as my base project, and will be updating as needed in the future.

This project uses TypeScript with Phaser (2.4.6).

### _Starter Simple

This project uses TypeScript with Phaser (2.4.6), and aims to be a simple version of the **_Starter** project.

## Tutorial creators worth following

The following sites are worth following if you're interested in Phaser tutorials.

- [Emanuele Feronato](http://www.emanueleferonato.com/) posts tutorials on a regular basis, and sells a couple complete tutorials.
- [GameDev Academy](https://gamedevacademy.org/) has a mix of posts, including in Phaser. This is done by the folks behind Zenva, which has a pretty good online series for sale that covers creating a variety of games in Phaser.
